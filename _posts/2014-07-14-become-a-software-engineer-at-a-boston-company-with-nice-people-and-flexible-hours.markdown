<h2 style="color: #000000;">What is the company?<&#47;h2></p>

We also work with top-tier shows like This American Life, The Moth, and 99% Invisible.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #444444;">We&rsquo;ve been around for 10 years, yet still have the entrepreneurial energy and opportunities of a much younger company. We genuinely care about a healthy work-life balance (we feel gross using buzzwords, but 40 hour weeks and flexible hours really are the norm around here).<&#47;p></p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">What is the Software Engineer job?<&#47;h2></p>
<p style="color: #444444;">We are looking for an enthusiastic and creative software engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable applications with simple interfaces. You'll have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and find your strengths across different technologies. We're a small organization, so within a few weeks you'll be expected take the lead and focus on a few projects while being comfortable with having an active support role for many of the other products we work on.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #444444;">You'll work closely with our other engineers, product managers, and employees on all phases of the development cycle including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. We don&rsquo;t follow Agile with a capital &ldquo;A&rdquo;, but work on hitting the sweet spot, which means you&rsquo;ll contribute to production code within a few days.<&#47;p></p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">What do we build?<&#47;h2></p>

<li>Relevant experience with frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Django, Angular and&#47;or a degree in Computer Science<&#47;li>

<li>Be a nice person<&#47;li>
<li>A design aesthetic and caring about how users interact with the things you build<&#47;li>
<li>Recommendations for public radio shows or podcasts that we might not have heard<&#47;li>
<li>Opinions you can back up are great. Opinions you want to experimentally verify are even better.<&#47;li><br />
