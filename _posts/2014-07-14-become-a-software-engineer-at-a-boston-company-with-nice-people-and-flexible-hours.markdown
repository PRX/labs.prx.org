<h2 style="color: #000000;">What is the company?</h2>
<p style="color: #444444;">At <a style="color: #1d80be;" href="http://www.prx.org/">PRX</a> you will find talented, passionate, and thoughtful people who create products that bring millions of listeners to shows created by public radio and podcast producers. We also work with top-tier shows like This American Life, The Moth, and 99% Invisible.</p>
<p style="color: #444444;">We’ve been around for 10 years, yet still have the entrepreneurial energy and opportunities of a much younger company. We genuinely care about a healthy work-life balance (we feel gross using buzzwords, but 40 hour weeks and flexible hours really are the norm around here).</p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">What is the Software Engineer job?</h2>
<p style="color: #444444;">We are looking for an enthusiastic and creative software engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable applications with simple interfaces. You'll have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and find your strengths across different technologies. We're a small organization, so within a few weeks you'll be expected take the lead and focus on a few projects while being comfortable with having an active support role for many of the other products we work on.</p>
<p style="color: #444444;">You'll work closely with our other engineers, product managers, and employees on all phases of the development cycle including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. We don’t follow Agile with a capital “A”, but work on hitting the sweet spot, which means you’ll contribute to production code within a few days.</p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">What do we build?</h2>
<p style="color: #444444;">If you checkout our public GitHub repositories you’ll get a sense of the projects, team members, technologies and how we work: <a style="color: #1d80be;" href="https://github.com/prx">https://github.com/prx</a>. Our core marketplace product <a style="color: #1d80be;" href="http://www.prx.org/">http://www.prx.org</a>is being upgraded to Angular.js and Rails 4 as an open source project. You can also see the iOS and Android apps we created and support <a style="color: #1d80be;" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/public-radio-exchange-prx/id312880534">https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/public-radio-exchange-prx/id312880534</a> and <a style="color: #1d80be;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Public+Radio+Exchange">https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Public+Radio+Exchange</a></p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">Things we’re looking for</h2>
<ul style="color: #444444;">
<li>Relevant experience with frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Django, Angular and/or a degree in Computer Science</li>
<li>Aptitude for learning new technologies/languages/platforms/APIs</li>
<li>Be a nice person</li>
<li>A design aesthetic and caring about how users interact with the things you build</li>
<li>Recommendations for public radio shows or podcasts that we might not have heard</li>
<li>Opinions you can back up are great. Opinions you want to experimentally verify are even better.</li>
</ul>
