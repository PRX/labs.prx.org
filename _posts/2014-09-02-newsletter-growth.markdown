We’ve been interested in trying out a listener focused email newsletter, learning what is involved, so that we can build an audience for producers that distribute with PRX. I’ve found that building an organic content focused newsletter isn’t easy, and I wanted to share some of the information that I’ve picked up along the way. This is the second in a series of updates that I provided PRX staff back in the spring of 2014.

If you are building an email mailing list I'd love to hear from you at matt@prx.org.

We sent out the second listener focused newsletter, Storytime, on Wednesday 04/23/1014. You can view the issue here:
(http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=b030d898f636b90f47f8cd820&id=9a8c5a4297)

The three stories selected this week:

* ARTSY: Turning sound into song - Wher@bouts - Resale Records 
* OMG: One man's quest to remove his swastika tattoo - Leaving a Mark (Uncensored)
* PROFOUND: The story of one of the most important, confusing, and troubling sentences of the past 12 years - 60 Words from Radiolab

Two of the stories exist on PRX.org the other pointed to Radiolab.

### Stats
* Total subscribers: 132 - UP from 70 previous week. Goal was 220
* Open rate: 36.6% - DOWN from 42% previous week. Goal was 50%
* Click rate: 6.3% - DOWN from 2% previous week. Goal was 4%.
* Unsubscribe requests: 1 - UP from 0 previous week.
* Reports of abuse: 0 - same as previous week.

### Subscriber Growth
We wanted to attract 150 new subscribers during the week.
* We’ve attracted 60. That projection was when we were still targeting India and Pakistan with ads. We found the quality of those subscribers to be of low value so we are seeing decreased volume, but higher quality subscribers. The 150 new subscribers was a finger in the wind goal, I think knowing that we’re acquiring ~10 new subscribers a day will help provide for better estimates and goals moving forward.

### Open Rate
We shot for 50% open rate, which in retrospect is insanely high. MailChimp reports that the Media and Publishing industry average is 17.9% so our list average of 44.7 is pretty great.

We ran an A/B test on subject lines and the links within the email. The two subject lines had very similar open rates (37.5% vs. 32.1%) but the number of times the emails were opened was quite interesting. The “swastika removal” subject line email variant was opened 8.6 times more than the more vanilla subject line. That resulted in only slightly more clicks, but think of each e-mails view as an impression and it’s clear that the more engaging subject line mattered.

### Landing Pages
I showed Audrey at PRX how to use the [Unbounce](http://www.unbounce.com) landing page tool. She very quickly created this new landing page which she is pointing to from social traffic:
* http://try.prx.org/storytime/ which has a 23% conversion.

The Google ad word landing page is converting at 13% so Audrey is winning. Go Audrey! That being said, after setup the ads run on their own, no humans involved, so while the google ad landing pages don’t perform as well they likely cost us less.

Unbounce has been a useful tool for quickly setting up landing pages without technical staff involvement.

### Google Ads
After dropping India and Pakistan we saw total click and impression volume decrease. I added a new ad, one that highlighted the “handpicked” nature of the curation vs. “FREE”. Free continues to win in terms of total impressions and a higher click through rate. Most importantly though the conversion rate for FREE was 3% while ‘handpicked was 0%.

Overall volume is down, but I think we’re getting a higher quality lead.

* Impressions: 11,520 DOWN from 43,000
* Clicks: 248 DOWN from 1,500
* CTR: 2.15% DOWN from 4%
* Cost: $153 DOWN from $764
* Cost Per Click: $0.62 UP from $0.49

### A few things worth noting
* Snip.ly has proven to be an effective tool to direct people to landing pages from social link sharing. Audrey has been using the service with her Tweets and Facebook posts. It has been responsible for 50% of subscriber sign-ups once it was used. You can see how it works here: http://snip.ly/oSD/#http://taperadio.org/3-stan-alcorn Notice the PRX banner at the bottom of the page. Please talk with Audrey about her experience with Snip.ly so far. It’s a valuable and free tool that we can use to market our work.
* We continue to investigate methods to market the mailing list. Audrey tweeted @radiolab to tell them that their story was featured. That resulted in @radiolab responding to us and a few leads driven to the signup. We’ll continue to reach out to producers who Audrey highlights.

### NEXT STEPS
* Create issue #3 of Storytime.
* Add subscription Call To Action (CTA) on mobile story views on www.prx.org. Convert visitors to subscribers. Monitor conversions from that functionality. Given the mobile traffic we’ve seen so far my guess is that we might convert < 5% of the traffic to subscribers. Which would result in ~30 new subscribers each day.
* Aim for 225 subscribers by the end of next week.
* Aim for 40% open rate
* Aim for 7% click rate 
* 13,000 Google Ad impressions 
* 350 Google Ad clicks
* $0.75 or less CPC

We’ve made a conscious decision not to poach from the Radiotopia/PRX.org user base. I think learning how to organically grow this list has been useful and forced us to think about how we market and attempt to attract new listeners. That being said, I think we’ll want to merge the lists in MailChimp at some point, using the segments and groups functionality that they provide.
