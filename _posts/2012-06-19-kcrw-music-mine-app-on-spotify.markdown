<p>When PRX worked with KCRW last year to design and develop the <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/about/musicmine-for-ipad">Music Mine app for iPad</a>, we knew that there was a reason we spent time and effort building a reusable API -- we just didn't know that we'd be building <a href="http://open.spotify.com/app/musicmine">a Spotify app</a> with it.</p>
<p>Last fall, the popular music-streaming service <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> announced that they were <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/about/apps/">creating a platform</a> for developers and music-focused companies to create apps that would be available in their desktop music software. Basically it's the ability to have an app inside of an app -- in our case Music Mine inside of Spotify.</p>
<p>KCRW recently reached out to PRX, and within a week, we had conceptualized, designed, built, and delivered a fully functional Music Mine Spotify app to KCRW. We got the word from KCRW late last week that the app had been approved. We're excited to be the <a href="http://open.spotify.com/app/musicmine">first public media app on the Spotify platform</a> and are even more excited to see the analytics and numbers once they are available.</p>
<p>If you use Spotify you can <a href="http://open.spotify.com/app/musicmine">click on this link</a> and it'll install the app for you.</p>
