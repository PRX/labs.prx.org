<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle Pro</a> for most of my iPhone and iPad wireframe jobs. I love the product, simple and easy to use. One of the things that I dig the most about it is the vibrant stencil and template community at <a href="http://graffletopia.com/">http://graffletopia.com/</a>. There are a number of stencils and templates that you can find out on the internet. The two that I've found to be most useful over the past few months are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-ux-template">OmniGraffle UX Template</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.morford.org/iphoneosdesignstencil/">iOS Design Stencil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are well thought out and I've been able to find and modify just about any component I've needed.</p>
