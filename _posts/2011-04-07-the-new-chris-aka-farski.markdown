<p><em>(this is a crosspost from the <a href="http://blog.prx.org">fabulous prx blog</a>)</em></p>
<p>I've landed here at PRX just a month after discovering the company. I was immediately intrigued by the work they are doing with lots of the public radio content I have grown to enjoy and trust, so when I saw their posting for a Rails developer I had to jump on the opportunity. My recent work history being filled with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> applications focusing on presenting data to users in the most effective ways possible. I've reached where I am through some print and web design, film and photo production, and even some financial services. Staying on top of the latest ideas and trends in technology, and thinking of ways to use them to help improve the world around us is something I'm passionate about.</p>
<p>PRX has brought me back to Boston, after graduating from the business school at <a href="http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/">Boston College</a> in 2004. In my time there I worked hard to understand where uses of technology in business and media worked, and where they were lacking or not being used to their full potential. It's amazing to be part of a company like PRX, which is at the forefront of enacting change in the storied world of public radio, bringing in a fresh generation of listeners and redefining the way radio content is delivered. I hope that with my background in user experience design and development I can help PRX continue to excel at reshaping public radio.</p>

I'm always up for a good movie or documentary, and finding a new best-band-ever happens more frequently than it probably should.</p>
