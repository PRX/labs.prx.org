<p>It's his birthday, <a href="http://benjamenwalker.com" target="_blank">go leave him a message</a>.</p>
<p>If you are too lazy for that link, just call: (877) 815-3013</p>
<p>How does it work? Here is the secret formula:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BenjamenWalker">@benjamenwalker</a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_12">40</a>  * ( <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">twilio</a> + <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a> + <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/">three.js</a>  + <a href="http://jplayer.org/">jplayer</a>) = <a href="http://www.easy-birthday-cakes.com/images/toilet-40th-birthday-cake-21322529.jpg">happy birthday</a></p>
<p>I worked on this over the course of a day and a half; the tools are out there people to make incredible stuff, and fast, even if you are an aging coder like me.  <a href="http://codeyear.com/">Go make something</a>!</p>
<p>(I also got some design inspiration from <a href="http://loveandradio.org/">@loveandradio</a>, but I lined everything up on the other side of the screen, so it is <b>completely different</b>.  Also, I've only seen Nick's head spin around like that when I got a concussion.)</p>
