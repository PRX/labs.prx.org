Hi everyone! We've decided to relaunch prx labs using github pages. By my calculations, we're
joining the party a fashionable number of years late. Thanks for bearing with me
while I get this all set up.


While we've always had a huge amount of amazing stuff to work on here, as we
move forward with our internal projects the nature of the decision making
process changes in a way that should result in even more interesting content for
the labs blog. And, the fact that much of what we'll be talking about is
[open-source](https://github.com/PRX), it will be that much easier to follow
along with us.
