<p>Submitting your shiny new iOS app to Apple for review is anxiety provoking. We've built a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;apps.prx.org">number of apps for both iOS and Android<&#47;a>&nbsp;and the review and approval process for iOS still makes me worry. We spend time developing apps, prepping marketing materials and coordinating press releases&nbsp;with PR firms on larger projects. You don't want to see this message just before your targeted launch date:</p>

<p>Enter the "canary build". We've do our best to adhere to code and UI guidelines that Apple publishes, they change, we try to keep up. Still, we've found that the only way to really know if your app is going to be approved is to actually submit it for review. We call these "canary builds". When we hit critical milestones in our development process we often will submit a build to Apple that we have no intention of releasing to the public. The approval process is a pain, but you really don't want to find out that you have an issue just days before your app is released. We use the setting "Release Control Hold for Developer Release" when submitting these updates so that we can get an app into the approval queue, have the Apple review team ferret out any potential issues and then make our changes.</p>
<p>After having a few apps rejected a little too close to a deadline we started using these as a way to catch things earlier in the process.</p>
<p>Hope that helps someone else.</p>
<p>That is all,<br />
Matt MacDonald</p>
