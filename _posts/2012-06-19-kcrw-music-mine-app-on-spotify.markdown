<p>When PRX worked with KCRW last year to design and develop the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.kcrw.com&#47;about&#47;musicmine-for-ipad">Music Mine app for iPad<&#47;a>, we knew that there was a reason we spent time and effort building a reusable API -- we just didn't know that we'd be building&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;open.spotify.com&#47;app&#47;musicmine">a Spotify app<&#47;a>&nbsp;with it.</p>
<p>Last fall, the popular music-streaming service&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.spotify.com">Spotify<&#47;a>&nbsp;announced that they were&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.spotify.com&#47;us&#47;about&#47;apps&#47;">creating a platform<&#47;a>&nbsp;for developers and music-focused companies to create apps that would be available in their desktop music software. Basically it's the ability to have an app inside of an app -- in our case Music Mine inside of Spotify.</p>
<p>KCRW recently reached out to PRX, and within a week, we had conceptualized, designed, built, and delivered a fully functional Music Mine Spotify app to KCRW. We got the word from KCRW late last week that the app had been approved. We're excited to be the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;open.spotify.com&#47;app&#47;musicmine">first public media app on the Spotify platform<&#47;a>&nbsp;and are even more excited to see the analytics and numbers once they are available.</p>
<p>If you use Spotify you can&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;open.spotify.com&#47;app&#47;musicmine">click on this link<&#47;a>&nbsp;and it'll install the app for you.</p>
